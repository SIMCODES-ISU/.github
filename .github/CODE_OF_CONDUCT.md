SIMCODES is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, color, creed, disability, gender identity, genetic
information, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, protected U.S. veteran status, or other protected class. We do not
tolerate harassment of summer school participants, staff, or faculty in any
form. Any participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from
the REU program at the discretion of the organizers. We expect participants to
follow these rules at all SIMCODES talks/research/activities and event-
related social activities. SIMCODES is also bound by Iowa State University
[policies](https://www.policy.iastate.edu/policy/discrimination, 2) on
discrimination and harassment.95 All participants are expected to
follow these policies for conduct and reporting of violations of the code of
conduct.
